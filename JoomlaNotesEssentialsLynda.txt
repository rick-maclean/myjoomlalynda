==========================================================================================================================
web host
vs 
web server
   web page request from user computer
   sends back: index.html, images, CSS, Flash files, JavaScript, and so forth 
   NOTE: php is just run on the server

CMS- A Content Management System or CMS is very different than static site.

index.php   
this tells the server to ask php (middleware) to get stuff from MySQL and process things before sending anything to the client.
PHP requests data
data sent to PHP
PHP arranges the information according to the PHP code
PHP is stripped out and replaced by html and sent to the client

therefore Joomla needs Apache or IIS, PHP and MySQL on the server (see Joomla.org)

In a world where we increasingly integrate photo galleries, calendars, social media, news feeds, blogs, and other dynamic 
information a CMS becomes more important due to the ease of integrating these features into the Web site. If you're still 
feeling like a CMS is complicated, don't panic. This movie was as geeky as the rest of this title gets. Keep watching and 
you will start feeling more comfortable with Joomla! shortly.

==================================================
Restoring the site from a backup using the jump-in files (if really really need it)
   see Chapter 1 01_05  (see zip and sql files)
   run xampp
   1) delete the joomla website from my htdocs
   2) copy the files from the zipped file to the location
   3) import sql into database inside phpMyAdmin. Click on my database and click on Drop icon
      create db joomla 
	  import sql data to get it imported (the extention will be different than in the video)
	  MAC :  error will be on database.  So on Mac need to have to adjust configeration file and change password to 'root' and save it 
	         then refresh and you can see it.

Backend Administrator
localhost/mywebsite/administrator

MACintosh localhost:8888/administrator

http://localhost/myJoomlaLynda/administrator
orhttp://localhost/myJoomlaLynda


A quick tour of the Joomla! interface=====================================================================
System menu 
Users menu
Menus menu 
Content menu 
Components menu 
Extensions menu 
Help menu 

Components 
Components are big functionalities that we add to Joomla!, they take up the entire screen when they display. 
So things like the Contact forms for the Web site are an example of that.
This also contains some Administrator side components as well that will be useful to you like updating 
to the next version of Joomla


Extensions 
Under Extensions this is where we can manage some additional pieces of functionality, I will cover the Language 
Manager in the chapter on multilingual Web sites so your Joomla! site can be presented in more than one language.
	Module Manager 
	Plugin Manager
	Template Manager 
	Language Manager 



Exploring responsive design in Joomla!=================================================================================
One of the great new features in Joomla! 3.0 is the fact that it is mobile compatible right out of the box.

The term was coined by Ethan Marcotte who defines responsive design as having 3 characteristics that were very important. 
1)  a flexible grid, 
2)  images that resize 
3)  is media queries, which is something you can use in CSS. 

So Joomla! 3.0 ships with the 
Bootstrap framework 
and this is a framework of HTML5, CSS3 and jQuery which is bundled 
together and maintained by Twitter, Twitter the company, not Twitter the application.

You can learn more about Bootstrap if you go to my course Up and Running with Bootstrap and it will go 
through just the Bootstrap side of things using Dreamweaver. 
But, since Joomla! ships with Bootstrap it's not only used here on the front-end for a template; it's 
also used in the back-end of the Web site. 


Modifying the global configuration===========================================================================================
this is where you configure the big pieces of your Joomla! Website. 

-- Include Site Name and Page Titles is a really important thing to turn on. 
-- Meta Description: search engines look at this.
eg  keywords in here are used by search engines so we can customize this for getting hits.
Write a short, precise meta description that's full of keywords that people will use to 
find your Website and make sure you put it on in here.

System tab: session setting says how long Admin can be logged on
Server tab: can set timezone 
Permissions tab: Access Control Lists 
Text Filters tab : this controls what kind of HTML tags various levels of users can put into their Website.

Using the Media Manger======================================================================================================
Media Manager is where you can upload images or PDFs or any kind of document that you'd like to display inside of 
your Joomla! Web site. 

Content : Media Manger 
or 
Control Panel

FOLDERS 
files in root and 
/banners
/headers
/sampledata

Can create any folders etc that we want and upload pictures

Options tab: only super admin should change this. 
    may want to add DOCX
	file size: maybe also need to adjust PHP max settings 


Creating content in Joomla!=================================================================================================

     3 steps CAM  (order is very important)
1) create a category for the content (if it does not already exist)
2)  create an article within that category
3) create a link to the article in the menu



=============================================================================================================
CHAPTER 3  Creating Categories
   ...
   ...
   ...
Creating categories for your site================================================================================
Cagegory Manager in Dashboard 
or
Content: Category Manager

She created the following categories 
							Home - Uncategorized category

							Products - Products category

							News & Info - News category
							   Solar Blog - Solar category
							   Press Releases - Press Release category

							About - About category
								Company Structure - About category
								Executives - About category

							Links - Weblinks component, no category needed

							Contact Us - Contact component, no category needed

to create do this: obvious from the interface

Publishing, unpublishing, and trashing categories==================================================================
check it and click on trash can
Filter: Trashed : then Empty Trash to really get rid of it

Alternatively just Unpublish it 

So remember that trashing something is actually a two-step process; you have to send it to the Trash and 
then you have the empty the trash to get rid of an item entirely and publishing in unpublishing are really 
probably the way you want to work with most of your content inside of Joomla!, it means that you have still 
got a copy of things available, if you ever need to republish it to the Web site, you can just click a button
and restore it to its previous state whereas trashing of course, it's a far more permanent kind of thing and 
it's hard to get content back, like impossible, if you do get rid of something from your Web site and then it 
turns out you need it later.

CHAPTER 4
 Creating Articles and Basic Formatting
   ...
   ...
   ...
Creating individual articles=================================================================================
goto Article Manager

Title
Category 

Formatting articles===========================================================================================
Headings etc etc etc

Tools available to us can be added to 
Extensions : Plugin Manager : find TinyMCE and click it 
change Functionality to Extended 
   tables, mediaEmbedded, paste MSWord, 
   turn off specific ones: TinyMCE : AdvancedParameters : turn off what I don't want 
   
JCE other Joomla editor plugin 


Adding an external link====================================================================================
www.windpoweringamerica.gov 
highlight text and click on link icon 
new or same window or tab?

Adding article images=======================================================================================
upload to media manager 
or 
one at a time for each article 

Click on Image button (find in library or browse) It will upload to current location in library 
NOTE: search engine likes desc and title 

Using Read More=============================================================================================
BLOG:
1) Add articles (each can be a blog entry)
2) Might want picture at end of article so not in summary 
3) Click in location for readmore   (click on ReadMore button on the bottom)
Keep adding articles.

Exploring featured articles and pages========================================================================
Create HOME Page 
1) Create article 
2) no category needed 
3) To make on HomePage do this:   make it a Featured Article (featured YES now see Star in list of articles)
4) now it appears on home page (will want some Details to not show up)

All Featured articles appear on home page. (publish, unpublished, trashed)

Publishing, unpublishing, and trashing articles==============================================================
We saw this already before.



=============================================================================================================
CHAPTER 5. 
Creating Menus for Your Site
   ...
   ...
   ...
Understanding and configuring menus==============================================================
Menu Manger (can create more menus eg FooterMenu)
Main Menu (most common used)

Where menu displays is set here:
Extensions : Module Manager : Main Menu(module position selected)

Linking an article to the menu==============================================================
On the menu page click NEW button
Menu Type : Article (to select the one I want) : Single Article : SelectSpecificOne

NOTE: Home page does not show up anywhere that I can find.
I can create featured articles by creating an article and having selecting the Featured button to green

Understanding parent and children menu items==============================================================
Again make a LINK to an article
I can then specify the PARENT ITEM to be one of the other menu items.
     NOTE I want the submenus to open up
	 
Configuring Category Blogs==============================================================
Solar Blog
1) Create News&Info menu link
2) Next create another link to Article : Category Blog : Select the Category of article I want in here.
3) This will show the stories for this category of blog
4) I already hear the graphic designers kind of complaining in the background.
Covered in the next video.



Advanced Category Blog configuration==============================================================
YUCK YUCK YUCK clean up articles
Menus : Solor Blog link(software) : ADVANCED!!!(Blog Layout)  : Block layout options
					Default  ChangeToBlogByBlog
Leading Articles  	1			0  
Intro Articles		4			20 
Columns				2			1 
Links				4			0

ORDER (Probably dont want this)??? Category Order, Article Order (featured?? most recent?? Oldest? Aphabetical, Most Hit?
										Article Manager Order??)
		Article Manager Order: go to articles and filter on category and drag and drop to order I want

So unless you absolutely positively have to have these articles in a certain order and ordering them something 
simple like by Date, putting the most recent one at the top of the page is not going to work for you, use one 
of those methods if at all possible because it will just be easier for your client to maintain the Web site 
once you're out of the picture you're done building. 
		
		
Configuring Category Lists==============================================================
Press Releases : Just want title showing up. 

Menu : Article : Category List : select category


Advanced Category List configuration==============================================================
Turn off Hits, Author, etc etc Have title for page.

List Layouts: turn off some things
Display Select 
Show Hists in List 
Show Author in List 

Title for Page:
Page Display
	Browser Page Heading (Shows in Chrome tabs)
	Show Page Heading : YES 
	Page Heading : NewsReleases RickLori


How about intro Text:
1) goto Category and put in a description
2) in menu do this  Category : Category Description : Show


Creating a featured blog for the News page and configuring the homepage==============================================================

Beef up the News and Info page: A selection of articles
can use Featured Articles from various categories show up here.
1) News and Info menu 
2) Menu type : Article : Featured Articles :  eg Software and Translation
3) Advanced Options (Layout) : Choose categories  (unselect All)
  adjust Leading Articles etc  0 20 1 0 
4) Featured articles in those categories will be shown.
5) If I want to adjust order then find  Category Order & Article Order etc.
6) Want a Title for this Page : Page Display Options : 
	Show Page Heading : YES 
	Page Heading : NewsReleases RickLori
	
HOME PAGE 
By default the home page is a featured item BLOG. So if I want to control what shows up then do this....
1) just show uncategoried articles 
Or
2) Change the home page to be Menu Item type of single article 
      SO just select a single article for the HOME page 
	  (BUG this does not work. It selects all articles with this category so do the following)	  
OR  I like this : create a category  HomePageArticle  and only show ones with the Category on the front page
OR maybe tags could be used???




Publishing, unpublishing, and trashing menu items==============================================================
This is how to have articles not showing up.
1) Unpublish Menu Link or Article  by checking or unchecking (best to unpublish menu link if just one article)



Creating a new menu and a login link, and displaying the menu in the footer==============================================================

FOOTER menu create
plus small login menu item and remove the BIG one.

1) create footer menu
 --MenuType no spaces allowed 

2) *****Linked Modules  this is key Click on this
 and location Protostart (footer position)
 give a Title and hide it
 
3) AddMenu item 
   type Users Manager : Login
   
   *****Now to remove the default on right do it via Module Manager
 



Creating menu aliases==============================================================
Home menu item on Footer : easiest to do this via an Alias
Note the alias was already set to 'home'

Footer Menu : New : type System Links : Menu Item Alias  
other options 
URL
Menu Heading
Text Separator ????

Reordering menu items==============================================================
Can change order of Login and Home
See icons on left of menu items.
Click at top
Then click beside menu item and 4 arrows show you can drag and drop



Adding products, moving the main menu, and configuring a dropdown menu==============================================================

DROPDOWN Menu
1) Created Products Menu
2) Move menu to another location : Module Manager : 
Position : Top center NO choose "Navigation" since that handles menus better
ShowDropdown : Yes 
3) Grrrr want horizontal
Menu Class Suffix " nav-pills" from bootstrap (found in CSS files it is a class) see space



Configuring secondary navigation==============================================================DONT WANT THIS!!!
On the right side Sub Navigation (old way of dong things) (PROBABLY DO NOT WANT THIS!!!!)
