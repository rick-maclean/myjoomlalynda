web host
vs 
web server
   web page request from user computer
   sends back: index.html, images, CSS, Flash files, JavaScript, and so forth 
   NOTE: php is just run on the server

CMS- A Content Management System or CMS is very different than static site.

index.php   
this tells the server to ask php (middleware) to get stuff from MySQL and process things before sending anything to the client.
PHP requests data
data sent to PHP
PHP arranges the information according to the PHP code
PHP is stripped out and replaced by html and sent to the client

therefore Joomla needs Apache or IIS, PHP and MySQL on the server (see Joomla.org)

In a world where we increasingly integrate photo galleries, calendars, social media, news feeds, blogs, and other dynamic 
information a CMS becomes more important due to the ease of integrating these features into the Web site. If you're still 
feeling like a CMS is complicated, don't panic. This movie was as geeky as the rest of this title gets. Keep watching and 
you will start feeling more comfortable with Joomla! shortly.

==================================================
Restoring the site from a backup using the jump-in files (if really really need it)
   see Chapter 1 01_05  (see zip and sql files)
   run xampp
   1) delete the joomla website from my htdocs
   2) copy the files from the zipped file to the location
   3) import sql into database inside phpMyAdmin. Click on my database and click on Drop icon
      create db joomla 
	  import sql data to get it imported (the extention will be different than in the video)
	  MAC :  error will be on database.  So on Mac need to have to adjust configeration file and change password to 'root' and save it 
	         then refresh and you can see it.

Backend Administrator
localhost/mywebsite/administrator

MACintosh localhost:8888/administrator

http://localhost/myJoomlaLynda/administrator
orhttp://localhost/myJoomlaLynda


A quick tour of the Joomla! interface=====================================================================
System menu 
Users menu
Menus menu 
Content menu 
Components menu 
Extensions menu 
Help menu 

Components 
Components are big functionalities that we add to Joomla!, they take up the entire screen when they display. 
So things like the Contact forms for the Web site are an example of that.
This also contains some Administrator side components as well that will be useful to you like updating 
to the next version of Joomla


Extensions 
Under Extensions this is where we can manage some additional pieces of functionality, I will cover the Language 
Manager in the chapter on multilingual Web sites so your Joomla! site can be presented in more than one language.
	Module Manager 
	Plugin Manager
	Template Manager 
	Language Manager 



Exploring responsive design in Joomla!=================================================================================
One of the great new features in Joomla! 3.0 is the fact that it is mobile compatible right out of the box.

The term was coined by Ethan Marcotte who defines responsive design as having 3 characteristics that were very important. 
1)  a flexible grid, 
2)  images that resize 
3)  is media queries, which is something you can use in CSS. 

So Joomla! 3.0 ships with the 
Bootstrap framework 
and this is a framework of HTML5, CSS3 and jQuery which is bundled 
together and maintained by Twitter, Twitter the company, not Twitter the application.

You can learn more about Bootstrap if you go to my course Up and Running with Bootstrap and it will go 
through just the Bootstrap side of things using Dreamweaver. 
But, since Joomla! ships with Bootstrap it's not only used here on the front-end for a template; it's 
also used in the back-end of the Web site. 


Modifying the global configuration===========================================================================================
this is where you configure the big pieces of your Joomla! Website. 

-- Include Site Name and Page Titles is a really important thing to turn on. 
-- Meta Description: search engines look at this.
eg  keywords in here are used by search engines so we can customize this for getting hits.
Write a short, precise meta description that's full of keywords that people will use to 
find your Website and make sure you put it on in here.

System tab: session setting says how long Admin can be logged on
Server tab: can set timezone 
Permissions tab: Access Control Lists 
Text Filters tab : this controls what kind of HTML tags various levels of users can put into their Website.

Using the Media Manger======================================================================================================
Media Manager is where you can upload images or PDFs or any kind of document that you'd like to display inside of 
your Joomla! Web site. 

Content : Media Manger 
or 
Control Panel

FOLDERS 
files in root and 
/banners
/headers
/sampledata

Can create any folders etc that we want and upload pictures

Options tab: only super admin should change this. 
    may want to add DOCX
	file size: maybe also need to adjust PHP max settings 


Creating content in Joomla!=================================================================================================

     3 steps CAM  (order is very important)
1) create a category for the content (if it does not already exist)
2)  create an article within that category
3) create a link to the article in the menu



=============================================================================================================
CHAPTER 3  Creating Categories
   ...
   ...
   ...
Creating categories for your site================================================================================
Cagegory Manager in Dashboard 
or
Content: Category Manager

She created the following categories 
							Home - Uncategorized category

							Products - Products category

							News & Info - News category
							   Solar Blog - Solar category
							   Press Releases - Press Release category

							About - About category
								Company Structure - About category
								Executives - About category

							Links - Weblinks component, no category needed

							Contact Us - Contact component, no category needed

to create do this: obvious from the interface

Publishing, unpublishing, and trashing categories==================================================================
check it and click on trash can
Filter: Trashed : then Empty Trash to really get rid of it

Alternatively just Unpublish it 

So remember that trashing something is actually a two-step process; you have to send it to the Trash and 
then you have the empty the trash to get rid of an item entirely and publishing in unpublishing are really 
probably the way you want to work with most of your content inside of Joomla!, it means that you have still 
got a copy of things available, if you ever need to republish it to the Web site, you can just click a button
and restore it to its previous state whereas trashing of course, it's a far more permanent kind of thing and 
it's hard to get content back, like impossible, if you do get rid of something from your Web site and then it 
turns out you need it later.

or 
one at a time for each article 

Click on Image button (find in library or browse) It will upload to current location in library
