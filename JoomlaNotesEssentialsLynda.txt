Course Outline

In this course, Jen Kramer shows how to use Joomla! to build a website from scratchâ€”all without a single line of code. 
Discover how to create and organize content, add menus and sidebars, change the look of the site with templates, control 
who creates and edits content, and much more. The course also shows you how to evaluate the quality of extensions, 
plugins, and templates and how to download and install them. Finally, Jen emphasizes the importance of backing up 
your Joomla! site, and explains how to create and store those backups.


Topics include:
What is Joomla!?
Completing Joomla! installation
Planning your website
Organizing content in Joomla!
Creating categories, articles, and menus
Formatting text and images
Using modules and components
Identifying and installing good-quality third-party extensions and templates
Supporting multiple languages with Joomla!
Managing users and their permissions
Changing the look of the site with templates
Launching your site

=========================================================================================================================
New Admin and Wesite templates
eg SEO (Search Engine Optimization Settings)
==========================================================================================================================
web host
vs 
web server
   web page request from user computer
   sends back: index.html, images, CSS, Flash files, JavaScript, and so forth 
   NOTE: php is just run on the server

CMS- A Content Management System or CMS is very different than static site.

index.php   
this tells the server to ask php (middleware) to get stuff from MySQL and process things before sending anything to the client.
PHP requests data
data sent to PHP
PHP arranges the information according to the PHP code
PHP is stripped out and replaced by html and sent to the client

therefore Joomla needs Apache or IIS, PHP and MySQL on the server (see Joomla.org)

In a world where we increasingly integrate photo galleries, calendars, social media, news feeds, blogs, and other dynamic 
information a CMS becomes more important due to the ease of integrating these features into the Web site. If you're still 
feeling like a CMS is complicated, don't panic. This movie was as geeky as the rest of this title gets. Keep watching and 
you will start feeling more comfortable with Joomla! shortly.

=======================================================================================================================
What is the plan for the website???  Outline

start with a plan 
build inside pages/content

Goals? Organizational Goals?
what's the reason it exists? 
who does it serve? 
what is it trying to achieve? 

Users 
who are they?
what do they want from the website?
where are they coming from?          computer, tablet, phone? 

========================================================================================================================
Intro Section

Joomla release cycle?
6 month release cycler
   short term releases  (7 months before end of life, no longer supporter) (eg 3.0, 3.1)
   long term release 18 months (eg 3.5)
   
   
=============================================================================================================

   ...
   ...
==================================================
Restoring the site from a backup using the jump-in files (if really really need it)
   see Chapter 1 01_05  (see zip and sql files)
   run xampp
   1) delete the joomla website from my htdocs
   2) copy the files from the zipped file to the location
   3) import sql into database inside phpMyAdmin. Click on my database and click on Drop icon
      create db joomla 
	  import sql data to get it imported (the extention will be different than in the video)
	  MAC :  error will be on database.  So on Mac need to have to adjust configeration file and change password to 'root' and save it 
	         then refresh and you can see it.

CHAPTER 2
   ...
   ...
   ...
Backend Administrator
localhost/mywebsite/administrator

MACintosh localhost:8888/administrator

http://localhost/myJoomlaLynda/administrator
orhttp://localhost/myJoomlaLynda


A quick tour of the Joomla! interface=====================================================================
System menu 
Users menu
Menus menu 
Content menu 
Components menu 
Extensions menu 
Help menu 

Components 
Components are big functionalities that we add to Joomla!, they take up the entire screen when they display. 
So things like the Contact forms for the Web site are an example of that.
This also contains some Administrator side components as well that will be useful to you like updating 
to the next version of Joomla


Extensions 
Under Extensions this is where we can manage some additional pieces of functionality, I will cover the Language 
Manager in the chapter on multilingual Web sites so your Joomla! site can be presented in more than one language.
	Module Manager 
	Plugin Manager
	Template Manager 
	Language Manager 



Exploring responsive design in Joomla!=================================================================================
One of the great new features in Joomla! 3.0 is the fact that it is mobile compatible right out of the box.

The term was coined by Ethan Marcotte who defines responsive design as having 3 characteristics that were very important. 
1)  a flexible grid, 
2)  images that resize 
3)  is media queries, which is something you can use in CSS. 

So Joomla! 3.0 ships with the 
Bootstrap framework 
and this is a framework of HTML5, CSS3 and jQuery which is bundled 
together and maintained by Twitter, Twitter the company, not Twitter the application.

You can learn more about Bootstrap if you go to my course Up and Running with Bootstrap and it will go 
through just the Bootstrap side of things using Dreamweaver. 
But, since Joomla! ships with Bootstrap it's not only used here on the front-end for a template; it's 
also used in the back-end of the Web site. 


Modifying the global configuration===========================================================================================
this is where you configure the big pieces of your Joomla! Website. 

-- Include Site Name and Page Titles is a really important thing to turn on. 
-- Meta Description: search engines look at this.
eg  keywords in here are used by search engines so we can customize this for getting hits.
Write a short, precise meta description that's full of keywords that people will use to 
find your Website and make sure you put it on in here.

System tab: session setting says how long Admin can be logged on
Server tab: can set timezone 
Permissions tab: Access Control Lists 
Text Filters tab : this controls what kind of HTML tags various levels of users can put into their Website.

Using the Media Manger======================================================================================================
Media Manager is where you can upload images or PDFs or any kind of document that you'd like to display inside of 
your Joomla! Web site. 

Content : Media Manger 
or 
Control Panel

FOLDERS 
files in root and 
/banners
/headers
/sampledata

Can create any folders etc that we want and upload pictures

Options tab: only super admin should change this. 
    may want to add DOCX
	file size: maybe also need to adjust PHP max settings 


Creating content in Joomla!=================================================================================================

     3 steps CAM  (order is very important)
1) create a category for the content (if it does not already exist)
2)  create an article within that category
3) create a link to the article in the menu



=============================================================================================================
CHAPTER 3  Creating Categories
   ...
   ...
   ...
Creating categories for your site================================================================================
Cagegory Manager in Dashboard 
or
Content: Category Manager

She created the following categories 
							Home - Uncategorized category

							Products - Products category

							News & Info - News category
							   Solar Blog - Solar category
							   Press Releases - Press Release category

							About - About category
								Company Structure - About category
								Executives - About category

							Links - Weblinks component, no category needed

							Contact Us - Contact component, no category needed

to create do this: obvious from the interface

Publishing, unpublishing, and trashing categories==================================================================
check it and click on trash can
Filter: Trashed : then Empty Trash to really get rid of it

Alternatively just Unpublish it 

So remember that trashing something is actually a two-step process; you have to send it to the Trash and 
then you have the empty the trash to get rid of an item entirely and publishing in unpublishing are really 
probably the way you want to work with most of your content inside of Joomla!, it means that you have still 
got a copy of things available, if you ever need to republish it to the Web site, you can just click a button
and restore it to its previous state whereas trashing of course, it's a far more permanent kind of thing and 
it's hard to get content back, like impossible, if you do get rid of something from your Web site and then it 
turns out you need it later.



==================================================================================================================
=============================================================================================================
CHAPTER 4
 Creating Articles and Basic Formatting
   ...
   ...
   ...
Creating individual articles=================================================================================
goto Article Manager

Title
Category 

To stop showing extra details I do not want:
1)Open the Article Manager.
2)Click on the Parameters icon near the top right of your screen.
3)Locate the Author Name, Created Date and Time and Modified Date and Time drop down fields in the Parameters list and change to Hide as required.
     Hide: Hides the information globally.
     Show: Displays the information globaly.
4)Click the Save.
These settings apply wherever "Use Global" is selected in the Article's parameters or menu item's parameters.

rick: my guess is that we can turn these on article by article basis.

Formatting articles===========================================================================================
Headings etc etc etc

Tools available to us can be added to 
Extensions : Plugin Manager : find TinyMCE and click it 
change Functionality to Extended 
   tables, mediaEmbedded, paste MSWord, 
   turn off specific ones: TinyMCE : AdvancedParameters : turn off what I don't want 
   
JCE other Joomla editor plugin 


Adding an external link====================================================================================
www.windpoweringamerica.gov 
highlight text and click on link icon 
new or same window or tab?

Adding article images=======================================================================================
upload to media manager 
or 
one at a time for each article 

Click on Image button (find in library or browse) It will upload to current location in library 
NOTE: search engine likes desc and title 

Using Read More=============================================================================================
BLOG:
1) Add articles (each can be a blog entry)
2) Might want picture at end of article so not in summary 
3) Click in location for readmore   (click on ReadMore button on the bottom)
Keep adding articles.

Exploring featured articles and pages========================================================================
Create HOME Page 
1) Create article 
2) no category needed 
3) To make on HomePage do this:   make it a Featured Article (featured YES now see Star in list of articles)
4) now it appears on home page (will want some Details to not show up)

All Featured articles appear on home page. (publish, unpublished, trashed)

Publishing, unpublishing, and trashing articles==============================================================
We saw this already before.



=============================================================================================================
CHAPTER 5. 
Creating Menus for Your Site
   ...
   ...
   ...
Understanding and configuring menus==============================================================
Menu Manger (can create more menus eg FooterMenu)
Main Menu (most common used)

Where menu displays is set here:
Extensions : Module Manager : Main Menu(module position selected)

Linking an article to the menu==============================================================
On the menu page click NEW button
Menu Type : Article (to select the one I want) : Single Article : SelectSpecificOne

NOTE: Home page does not show up anywhere that I can find.
I can create featured articles by creating an article and having selecting the Featured button to green

Understanding parent and children menu items==============================================================
Again make a LINK to an article
I can then specify the PARENT ITEM to be one of the other menu items.
     NOTE I want the submenus to open up
	 
Configuring Category Blogs==============================================================
Solar Blog
1) Create News&Info menu link
2) Next create another link to Article : Category Blog : Select the Category of article I want in here.
3) This will show the stories for this category of blog
4) I already hear the graphic designers kind of complaining in the background.
Covered in the next video.



Advanced Category Blog configuration==============================================================
YUCK YUCK YUCK clean up articles
Menus : Solor Blog link(software) : ADVANCED!!!(Blog Layout)  : Block layout options
					Default  ChangeToBlogByBlog
Leading Articles  	1			0  
Intro Articles		4			20 
Columns				2			1 
Links				4			0

ORDER (Probably dont want this)??? Category Order, Article Order (featured?? most recent?? Oldest? Aphabetical, Most Hit?
										Article Manager Order??)
		Article Manager Order: go to articles and filter on category and drag and drop to order I want

So unless you absolutely positively have to have these articles in a certain order and ordering them something 
simple like by Date, putting the most recent one at the top of the page is not going to work for you, use one 
of those methods if at all possible because it will just be easier for your client to maintain the Web site 
once you're out of the picture you're done building. 
		
		
Configuring Category Lists==============================================================
Press Releases : Just want title showing up. 

Menu : Article : Category List : select category


Advanced Category List configuration==============================================================
Turn off Hits, Author, etc etc Have title for page.

List Layouts: turn off some things
Display Select 
Show Hists in List 
Show Author in List 

Title for Page:
Page Display
	Browser Page Heading (Shows in Chrome tabs)
	Show Page Heading : YES 
	Page Heading : NewsReleases RickLori


How about intro Text:
1) goto Category and put in a description
2) in menu do this  Category : Category Description : Show


Creating a featured blog for the News page and configuring the homepage==============================================================

Beef up the News and Info page: A selection of articles
can use Featured Articles from various categories show up here.
1) News and Info menu 
2) Menu type : Article : Featured Articles :  eg Software and Translation
3) Advanced Options (Layout) : Choose categories  (unselect All)
  adjust Leading Articles etc  0 20 1 0 
4) Featured articles in those categories will be shown.
5) If I want to adjust order then find  Category Order & Article Order etc.
6) Want a Title for this Page : Page Display Options : 
	Show Page Heading : YES 
	Page Heading : NewsReleases RickLori
	
HOME PAGE 
By default the home page is a featured item BLOG. So if I want to control what shows up then do this....
1) just show uncategoried articles 
Or
2) Change the home page to be Menu Item type of single article 
      SO just select a single article for the HOME page 
	  (BUG this does not work. It selects all articles with this category so do the following)	  
OR  I like this : create a category  HomePageArticle  and only show ones with the Category on the front page
OR maybe tags could be used???




Publishing, unpublishing, and trashing menu items==============================================================
This is how to have articles not showing up.
1) Unpublish Menu Link or Article  by checking or unchecking (best to unpublish menu link if just one article)



Creating a new menu and a login link, and displaying the menu in the footer==============================================================

FOOTER menu create
plus small login menu item and remove the BIG one.

1) create footer menu
 --MenuType no spaces allowed 

2) *****Linked Modules  this is key Click on this
 and location Protostart (footer position)
 give a Title and hide it
 
3) AddMenu item 
   type Users Manager : Login
   
   *****Now to remove the default on right do it via Module Manager
 



Creating menu aliases==============================================================
Home menu item on Footer : easiest to do this via an Alias
Note the alias was already set to 'home'

Footer Menu : New : type System Links : Menu Item Alias  
other options 
URL
Menu Heading
Text Separator ????

Reordering menu items==============================================================
Can change order of Login and Home
See icons on left of menu items.
Click at top
Then click beside menu item and 4 arrows show you can drag and drop



Adding products, moving the main menu, and configuring a dropdown menu==============================================================

DROPDOWN Menu
1) Created Products Menu
2) Move menu to another location : Module Manager : 
Position : Top center NO choose "Navigation" since that handles menus better
ShowDropdown : Yes 
3) Grrrr want horizontal
Menu Class Suffix " nav-pills" from bootstrap (found in CSS files it is a class) see space



Configuring secondary navigation==============================================================DONT WANT THIS!!!
On the right side Sub Navigation (old way of dong things) (PROBABLY DO NOT WANT THIS!!!!)

1) Module Manager : New menu module : Menu : SubNaviagation (Hide Title)
position right-7
Display : Main Menu

 tweek
Menu Assignment : "On all pages except" : unselect all : 
--not footer menu
Main Menu
--not home page 

twek more
Basic Options : Base Item "current" : Start Level "2"




=============================================================================================================
CHAPTER 6. 
6. Advanced Article Formatting
   ...
   ...
   ...

Linking to a PDF or other document==============================================================================
1) Put PDFs in the Media manager
2) Create a link to it on a page 
3) Make sure they are small in size since they are downloaded



Dividing and formatting long articles using page breaks and the Pagebreak plugin======================================
Accordian Panaels  (things open and close as you click)
eg bio on execs to the company

1) put in page breaks before Rick and Lori
2) Lets improve the look of this.
     Extensions : PluginManager : Content-Pagebreak : Presentation Sytle (set to Sliders)
	 NOTE: I like TABS
3) I can get rid of Heading in the article so our names only show up in Tab 




Customizing which HTML tags are permitted by changing the text filter in Joomla!===============================================

Embed YouTube video etc.
I'd like to put a YouTube video inside of my Joomla! article. But when you try to embed something like a YouTube article 
or Twitter feed or Facebook feed or etc ... Joomla! tends to strip out the code that you paste in. 
This is a feature not a bug. (security issue)

Also the editor  inside of Joomla!  TinyMCE, also strips out a set of tags 

SO people adding content to our site cannot put in something we don't want.

THEREFORE: how to tweek those settings
1)
************ Global Configuration : Text Filters (tab)
SEE super user, administrator (no Filtering)
2)
********** tinyMCE see below

Default Black List- will allow you to put in any kind of HTML except for tags that are on the Black List. 
Custom Black List- would let you put in any kind of HTML except for tags that you define. 
White List- means that only tags you specify are permitted, 
No HTML- means you can't put any HTML and are all just straight text, 
No Filtering- means nothing is filtered at all

Authors, the Editors, the Publishers, the Managers, 
all have a default Black List that will strip tags out and some of those tags are typically the 
****** iFrame tag or the Java's Applet tag 
is another one that frequently gets stripped out, because these can be potentially harmful to your computer and to your 
Joomla! system.

2) TinyMCE
Extensions : Plugin Manger : TinyMCE

a) Functionality : Extended 
b) see Prohibited Elements (script, applet, iframe(YouTube))
remove iframe
this will allow superuser to do this but still others still wont since iframe  is in the Black List



Adding a YouTube video to an article
Now add Mark's YouTube video
1) goto YouTube video
2) click Share to get the Embed button to show up
3)  click Embed (to get the iframe tag)
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tri4Hda0oyg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
4) Goto Article
Click html view of editor
Paste iframe

Using article-specific images and links=====================================================================================
Have a tiny version of the image appear on the blog page but the full size on the article

Go to Article : see 
Images and links tab
set up 'intro image' and 'full article image' for each article
1) will need to produce smaller versions of the images and upload them (WordPress does this automatically)
2) float (suggest use Global setting)
3) Alt Text
4) Delete the one I pasted in.

http://extensions.joomla.org/profile/extension/photos-a-images/images/resize-image-on-the-fly-and-cache

Want all images to appear the same way
1) Article Manger
2) Options :Editing Layout 
3) Administrator Images and Links (Yes No)  
    links at bottom or articles can turn off if we are not using this feature
4) URL open in Parent window or .....
5) Intro Image Float (left right none etc)




Styling images with bootstrap classes========================================================================================
Probably can look at this on the bootstrap page

Add pizzaz to images 
Bootstrap Classes styles (Round corners)
getbootstrap.com : Css : Images : 
see this
<img src="..." alt="..." class="img-rounded">
<img src="..." alt="..." class="img-circle">
<img src="..." alt="..." class="img-thumbnail">

How to apply this in Joomla???  (I did not see that little image editor)
1) goto article
2) click on image
3) use little tree icon in TinyMCE 
4) apply the class

Therefore I just went into html and added 
class="img-rounded"
to the image in the html



=============================================================================================================
CHAPTER 7. 
7. Setting Display Options
   ...
   ...
   ...
Setting global configuration options for articles==============================================================
By default too much junk in Articles do globally then change article by article
Globally:
Article Manager : Options :
Show Title no/yes keep showing
Linked Titles (this goes to article when shown in blog list so I like this.)
Show Category (Hide)
Link Category (NO)
Show Author (NO)
Publication Date (NO)

Show Navigation: PREV and NEXT buttons

Read More: Show Title  (this is better for search engines)

Show Icons
Show Print Icon
Show Email Icon      all associated with the gear so maybe dont want this.



Setting menu display options===================================================================================
In Blog
1) have Links for titles
2) remove ReadMOre buttons 

Can do for one single menu item for all these blogs 

Menu Manager : Main Menu : Software Stories : Advanced Options : Article (now we can change things in here)
Show "Read More" : Hide
Show TItle with Read More : Hide


Comparing page headings, article titles, and browser page titles===============================================
--page headings (needed to set for menu and had to say Show in page display area)
--article titles (with article)
--browser page titles (shows in tabs of Chrome)

Turning off the homepage heading================================================================================
HOME (Show Page Heading NO)

Configuring the back-end and front-end article administrator screens and options================================
Configurations Screens for getting rid of configurations screens

Article Manger : Options : Editing Layout  (allows you to change what options are available when editing)


=============================================================================================================
CHAPTER 8. 
8. Using Modules
   ...
   ...
   ...

Configuring modules===============================================================================
Content appears in the Middle of the page
Modules appear in other areas.
eg) We created a footer menu (module) in the footer area

MODULE: 
--A module is any bit of functionality that you'd like to display in some area other than the main part of the Web page. 
-- It could be something that displays in the Header, the Footer, the left or the right columns, across the top, 
or even inside an article.

Every template comes with certain module positions, these are positions coded by the person who created the template, 
which will ultimately contain the modules for that page.

HOW TO SEE POSITIONS:
backend : Template Manger : Options : Preview Nodule Positions (enable)
--now click on the eyeball icon by the template



Creating a search module==============================================================================
Extensions : Module Manager : New+ : ModuleTypes(can find more online) : 

see Search & SmartSearch(like GoogleSearch)
NOTE: SmartSearch might not work with content in nonJoomla modules
 
 choose Search position 0 
 various options
 Menu Assignment (can limit which pages it appears on)
 
 
 
Creating a custom HTML module==============================================================================
A mini article
*******!!!!!!!How to put testimonials (rick/lori) on right column of home page Like MacLeanManuscirpt.com
Extensions : Module Manager : New+ : Custom HTML Module
Title: Rick
Position 7
CustomOutput : here is where text goes

I can put a number of them here and also just have them show up on the home page.

Modifying the breadcrumb module=============================================================================
Shows where you are on the web site (Path)
Let's put it at top of page and not on Home Page
Try Top Center 3
Menu Assignment (not on home page)
Hide Title    (Breadcrumbs position does not show the title.)

Creating a random image module=============================================================================
Left Column 
Chooses it randomly from a folder 
Extensions : Random Image : Position 8 : choose folder and size etc
Media Manager to upload a bunch of pictures 
    can prepare in Photoshop
	

Including a module in an article using loadposition========================================================
How about having random image in main HomePage article.
1) Edit the article:First of all I am going to edit my article and I am going to add a little piece of code I'll show and I'll 
assign a name for that particular module position,
{loadposition randomRick}  <---put this at the end of hte article

2) then  go to the back end of Joomla! in the Module Manager and take random image module  and 
assign it to the module position that we just created, 
Extensions : Module Manager : Select Random Image module and set position type in the text randomRick
Also adjust the image size to match what was chosen in Photoshop



Exploring administrator modules and turning on the Joomla! version========================================
on the backend there are Administrator modules that can be handy

Extensions : Module Manger : on left can click on Adminsitrator for modules for the backend 

eg to show the Joomla Version when in Admin mode (Isis)




=============================================================================================================
CHAPTER 9. 
9. Using Components  (ONLY ONE PER PAGE eg content)
   ...
   ...
   ...
Using the content component=======================================================
Content : is a component
--Content is a kind of component, and it shows up in the main part of the Web page. 
--There is only one component per page, while there may be many modules on the same page. 
--components require configuration
--components need to be assigned to a menus
--a component may have a module associated with it.

SEE: Components MENU on backend

Create Menu Item : Then you link to a Component type (eg System Links, Wrapper etc etc)


Using the contact component=======================================================
to avoid spam mail
1) Make contact Category (for contacts)
2) Create contact like doing an article

Formatting the contact page=======================================================
Let's improve the contact page 
1) remove icons
2) no slider 

Components : Contacts : Contacts : Options
1) Display Format : make Plain 
2) IconsTab : Settings --> None 

Here is more info:
You can build your own form using one of these third-party extensions. RSFormsPro is one from a 
place called rsjoomla.com. It's a great extension. It has a small price tag associated with it
It'll also record everything from that form into a spreadsheet that you can then export in CSV 
format, or you can look at it in Excel, or you can look at it in Access, or whatever it is that 
you want to do with that data.


Configuring CAPTCHA for a form=======================================================
Like Contact form
Plugin Manager : Captcha -ReCaptcha
follow link to Google Link reCaptcha   http://www.google.com/recaptcha
then get public and private keys

save and close

NOW 
system : global config : default captcha --> select the plugin

This Captcha plug-in will show on the bottom of all of your contact forms, by default.
It will also show up at the bottom of any user registration forms that you might have available 
on the front-end of the Web site,


Creating a contact list=======================================================
Eg, could send email to a list of contacts????
1) create more contacts
Components : Contacts : Contacts : New
Name, Email, Images, ContactCategory etc 

2) could make links to single contacts Or
Contacts Menu : Contacts : ListInCategory : Management

Now list of Contacts for the site. 


Formatting the contact list=======================================================
Components : Contacts : Contacts : Options 
List Layouts tab : 
Display Select : Hide 
Table Headings : Hide 
hide city state and country too\
hide phone 




Using the weblinks component=======================================================
Link to other web sites 

Links 
Components : Weblinks (Links and Categories like contacts) 
1) make categories 
2) make links 
3) make menu item to point to links Menu : New : Weblinks : List All WebLink Categories 

changes to look and feel 
Weblinks : Options 
?? Open in New Window
No Icon 

List Layouts tab
Display Select : off
Hits : off




Using the redirect component=======================================================
Google may pull up our old page instead of the new website when we are moving to the new system 
eg moving from WordPress, Drupal etc

404 error if page not there now.

eg 
www.macleanmanuscript.com/prayerletters   (does not exist so get 404 error) 

Components : Redirect Component :  will see ones that failed 
sooooo can have these go to a good URL 
enable it 
save and close 





=============================================================================================================
CHAPTER 10. 
10. Using Templates (Themes in Wordpress and Drupal)
   ...
   ...
   ...
Changing the look of the site using templates====================================================================

Introducing the Hathor admin template====================================================================
Admin Templates:
  can download some or use Isis or Hathor
  visual and motor disabilities (keyboard only)
  
NOTE: can assign specific templates for specific users 


Customizing the Isis admin template================================================================================
Extensions : Template Manager : Options 
colors
collapse admin menu (if on small monitor) (No to prevent resizing)

Working with Joomla! templates from third-party providers=============================================================
If you do a quick Google Search for Joomla templates, you'll turn up a zillion results,

eg:
www.joomlabamboo.com 
www.rockettheme.com/joomla

One of thing that I have found to be helpful through the years is when I provide a price for a Web site, I like to add about 
10% of the cost of that Web site 
into a little slush fund, as I call it, and I tell my clients that little fund is available for me to purchase templates, or 
extensions, and I will certainly not exceed the cost of that 10%, but I may spend a little bit of money within that pool, 
in addition to the cost of the Web site as a whole. That gives you a little bit of flexibility, so that you have the ability 
to buy an extension, or buy a template as required, but you don't have to take that out of the money that you're being paid 
for your time to build the Joomla Web site that your client hired you to do.

CHAPTER 12. 
12. Access Control List (ACL) Essentials
   ...
   ...
   ...
Introduction to ACL=====================================================================================
Permissions
For small Web sites, where you may have one person, or a handful of people maintaining the Web site, 
it's likely you won't even need ACL at all.

Exploring default groups in Joomla!=====================================================================
Users

User Groups
Public : visitors
Guest : New to Jooomla 3 --> content to disapear when someone logs in to web site
Manager (back end but less than administrator)
Administrator (can do almost everything except Global Configuration, and other Options)
Registered : Can log in (maybe hide soem stuff)
Author (can create and edit their own, not publish )
Editor (can edit anyone's )
Publisher (can create content and publish)
Super Users (can do anything)


GUEST NEW : Guest group is, sometimes you'd like some content that shows up on the Web site by default when people 
are visiting the Web site, and they are not logged in at all, but when someone is logged into the Web site, you'd 
like that content to disappear, and you'd like people to be able to see a different option instead, and that is the 
function of the Guest group.

13. Extending Joomla! 3
   ...
   ...
   ...
Evaluating extensions in the Joomla! Extensions Directory========================================================================
There are three main kinds of extensions. 
1)components,   MAIN PART OF PAGE
2)modules,      SUPPORTING ELEMENTS AROUND EDGES
3)plug-ins      ARE LITTLE BEHIND THE SCENES FUNCTIONALITY WE CAN TURN ON/OFF

see:  extensions.joomla.org 

eg Akeeba Backup 
things to look for 
Editors Pick, Poplular , Rating, C M P (component, module or plugin --can be all)
Dates: when last updated and version to see how actively being worked on
Read Reviews : see if developer responds to bad reviews

Installing and creating a backup with Akeeba Backup========================================================================
Akeeba Backup  **** can save a version 
  BUT NEED Akeeba Kickstart to recover 
  
Installing and creating a site map with Xmap==================================================================================
Xmap????
Do we want this??? not really needed

Upgrading extensions===========================================================================================================
Get Updates for Extensions regularly!!!!

Get Rid of extension you are not going to use.

NOTE: Control Panel will show if extensions need to be updated
BUT:  verify this



=============================================================================================================
CHAPTER 14. 
14. Launching Your Site and Beyond
   ...
   ...
   ...
Preparing a site for launch=========================================================================================================
Move to a web server 
1) make sure Admin password is strong and login name is strong 
2) zip up files in htdocs to upload (highlight and send to compressed folder (zip))
3) export sql file
MAC localhost:8888/PHPMyAdmin


Launching a site====================================================================================================================
cPanel control panel 
1) upload zip file 
File : File Manager : PublicHTMP or www
remove all files 
click Upload zip file 
now Extract Files button 

2) cPanel : Databases : mySQL Database Wizard 
a) create a DB
b) Username and Password  (root and nopassword)  so create secure username and password with privilages 

3) Database : PHPMyadmin : username and password : do like I would on PC Import it 

NOW: ensure usernames and passwords are ok
configuration.php file to change these so it works now.


FIX login for UserJoe
administrator  change users and paths to 
Control Panel : Menus : Footer Menu : Login : change path under advanced options
macleanmanuscript.com/



Placing a site in offline mode and changing the offline image========================================================================
Testing for client to see but not public to see just yet

1) Global Configuration : Site Offline (YES/NO)
2) Now can only get in via a username and password  ACL only allows this and can do with super user
3) Can change the custom message etc etc in Global Configuration


Thinking about site maintenance and front-end editing=================================================================================
1) Train client to make their own changes on front end 
2) Login
3) see gear for article so can edit the content
4) can configure Joomla to just give Clients specific environment so they cannot break things but could add a menu or article etc 


SEO Metadescription and Keywords


Understanding the importance of backups and coordinating backups with a web host=================================================
WebHost should make a backup of your site etc.
Do periodic offsite backups. (akeeba backup can do this)  
           (we can do this via phpMyAdmin and github or Lori's computer)

Updating your Joomla! site and the Joomla! update notification=====================================================================
every 4-6 weeks Joomla does a new release.
normally bug fixes
1) make a backup of the web site
2) then do upgrade 
3) Test it : sometimes 3rd party extensions will break so may need to restore from backup.

See 
Components : Joomla Updates (will not necessarily show the latest updates)
can click on Options and see settings to see what is next

Working with language overrides============================================================================
Bugs were fixed in 3.0.2 so this is what was discussed here. Eg English, Italian etc 
Eg search box: Search... can 

Extensions : Language Manager : Overrides on left 
can then do a Search for what you are looking for eg "Read More..."


Working with multilingual associations============================================================================
When you click on the flag it goes to the homepage vs just changing the language on that page

Plugin Manager : System - Language Filter
----with this you can associate Menu items with those of the other language and also can do an association 
    between Articles of the other language too.
